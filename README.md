# Jerry's Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, and NextJS. This was a good opportunity to showcase my work and qualifications while re-affirming my learning of these web dev technologies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The purpose of this site was to solidify the learning of:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the css utility classes that allowed for rapid development
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to learn type safety in JavaScript
- [CSS Flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)
- [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
